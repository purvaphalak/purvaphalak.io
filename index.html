								<p> Hello There!👋

									<p> Welcome to my portfolio! 😃 
									<p> ➺ I'm a Data Analyst with a passion for finding valuable insights hidden in complex data. With a foundation in Civil Engineering and a successful transition to the dynamic field of data analytics, I've developed solid skills in analyzing data, solving problems, and communicating effectively.</p>

									<p> ➺ Switching from Civil Engineering to data analytics has been an exciting journey where I've combined my problem-solving mindset with tools like 𝐌𝐢𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐨𝐟𝐭 𝐄𝐱𝐜𝐞𝐥,  𝐒𝐐𝐋 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫-𝐁𝐈.</p>

									<p> ➺ Some highlights of my work include: <p>

									<p> ➥ Analyzing, transforming and visualizing data using tools like Power BI and Excel.<p>

									<p> ➥ Writing SQL queries to extract and explore data effectively.<p>

									<p> ➥ Creating insightful dashboards to make decision-makinng easier.<p>

									<p> ➥ Transforming raw data into practical solutions for real-world problems. </p>

									<p> ➺ I developed my core skills through focused learning and hands-on practice, including internships at Cognifyz Technologies, Mentorness, and PwC. During these internships, I worked on projects like NREGA analysis (using Power-BI), Epidemic(Covid-19) Analysis(using MySQL), Customer Churn Analysis, and Diversity and Inclusion dashboards. </p>

									<p> ➺ These experiences helped me turn raw data into actionable insights, whether it was through designing interactive dashboards in Power BI or performing in-depth SQL analyses.</p>

									<p> ➺ Some of my favorite projects include tackling real-world challenges like analyzing Electric vehicle market trends and optimizing Twitter engagement strategies. </p>

									</p>➺ What I love most about data analytics is combining technical expertise with innovative projects that push boundaries and create data-driven solutions. I’m motivated by curiosity and a desire to keep learning, always looking to improve my skills and contribute meaningfully. </p>

									<p> ➺ My portfolio showcases the projects I've undertaken during internships and self-learning, reflecting my dedication to professional growth.</p>
